ANNOTATION AND REFERENCES FOR EXPERIMENTAL DATA

- In scott2010_chure2022(...).csv, we present experimental measurements of growth rates and ribosomal mass fractions as calculated by Chure et al. [1] from measurements obtained by Scott et al. [2] for E.coli grown in different media and in presence of different chloramphenicol concentrations. Namely,
	-- scott2010_chure2022_annotated.csv provides these data with annotations
	-- scott2010_chure2022_notext.csv provides these data without any text for the ease of being read by Matlab programs
	-- scott2010_chure2022_errors.xlsx shows how the S20 and n0 parameters of the errors' prior distributions were calculated from these data for the DRAM algorithm

- In 55_yrs_(...).csv, we store experimental data from 26 different experimental studies conducted over the last 55 years, which were complied together  by Chure et al. [1]. Namely,
	-- 55_yrs_ribosomes.csv matches measured ribosomal mass fractions with corresponding growth rates
	-- 55_yrs_elongation.csv matches translation elogation rates with corresponding growth rates
	-- 55_yrs_heterologous.csv matches heterologous protein mass frations with ratios of the corresponding growth rates to the growth rate of cells not expressing any synthetic genes
